/**
 * This file is a simple wrapper for Pimple so Yapeal is future proofed against
 * changes to it's API.
 *
 * PHP version 5.4
 *
 * This is a wrapper / adapter to Pimple. Ran into many problems in composer
 * etc with trying to use version 2.0.x or master from Pimple as most other
 * projects on Packagest require 1.1.x and there was no way to resolved the
 * conflicts.
 *
 * Original the way I (Michael Cummings) thought of to solve the conflict was
 * to just add copy of the Pimple file from version 2.0.0 into Yapeal itself
 * but did mean having to maintain it from then on and manually merging any
 * local changes with external ones from the main project which is NOT a good
 * long term way to do things.
 *
 * I decided I need a better solution and after a few weeks of looking at
 * submodules and the drawbacks with them I decided they would NOT work, but
 * did ran into ```git subtree``` which does seem to fit in to what was needed
 * and does NOT have the drawbacks that submodules had.
 *
 * This file is part of Yet Another Php Eve Api Library also know as Yapeal
 * which can be used to access the Eve Online API data and place it into a
 * database.
